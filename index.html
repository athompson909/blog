        <h3>Prologue</h3>
        <p>So I arrived in Chile at the Chacalluta (Peru/Chile) border crossing.  I ended up making it a lot early than expected (like way early) and that meant I had most of the day to myself in Arica.  I’d gotten to Tacna from Arequipa in an overnight bus and I slept super well the whole way there, but we arrived at 3:50, which is soooo early.  So pretty much after that I found out there’s an international terminal you go to so I walked over and then got in a colectivo heading to the border.  About 45 minutes later we were at the border, and everything was so slick, we were in and out in about 15 minutes.  From there the taxista took us to Arica (another 20 minutes).</p>
        <h3>Arica</h3>
        <p>Initially arriving in Arica I was slightly nervous because I wasn’t planning on even going there, so I didn’t really know anything about it haha.  I hurried up and looked up stuff about it and took out some chilean pesos out of an ATM and tried to figure out this whole new country all alone and that was a lot to take in for one small boy at 5 in the morning all by himself.  Luckily, I figured it out.  Arica was beautiful.  It’s a little coastal town in the Atacama desert (the world’s driest desert).  I walked from the bus terminal to the centro, it took about 20 minutes, and it was fun to just take in all the new sights.  I then went around looking for a place to crash for a few hours (in peru they were always called hospedajes but here they’re only called hostales) cuz I wanted a nap and a shower.  So that was the first taste of chilean high prices.   I finally found a place that let me stay from 7-3pm for 15,000 pesos.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[0].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[0].src}}"></div>
        <p>Haha as I’m writing this I realize I’m keeping in every single detail.  But I don’t think I have time to write about every little thing.  Oh... I got breakfast in this little bakery and I got a chicken empanada and it was alright.</p>
        <p>That day I did some napping and then walked around in the centro.  There was this sick highway that kind of went along the coast and the plaza was close by.  There were stores and stuff and I got jugo at this market and was just slipping out pesos left and right.  There was a huge rock hill with a chilean flag on the top on one side.  I found out you could walk to the top of it... so naturally I walked up it.  It was like the shortest walk ever.  Up at the top there were some great views and I had a good chat with this guy that was asking me if I smoked weed (everybody down there does that) and then I went back down, and took a taxi for 10,000 pesos to the airport.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[1].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[1].src}}"></div>
        <p>From the airport I took a late afternoon flight to Santiago.  I arrived at SCL around 8:00 and thanks to the fact that it was summer in Chile the sun was out.  Renzo’s uncle came and picked us up and the freeway layout of santiago reminded me a ton of Utah.  It was nuts.  That night I met Vilchez’s mom (who’s name I can’t remember at the moment), Jorge (her second husband) and Jair, Renzo’s little brother and I kind of like his name.  They were so nice to let me stay with them in Santiago.</p>
        <h3>Santiago time</h3>
        <p>I found Santiago very impressive.  It was light years ahead of Lima in all aspects, the streets were organized, the metro was fast, and the landscaping was on point.  Me and Renzo hiked <span>El Cerro San Cristobal</span> all the way up to the top, that gave us a pretty good view of everything in the city.  After that we got some mote con huesillo, this chilean drink that I have mixed feelings about... but it was super chilean.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[2].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[2].src}}"></div>
        <p>After finding our way down the hill (and almost falling in front of these other Americans and kind of feeling embarrassed about that) we hit the metro and went to see the white house of chile.  Coincidentally there was a Picasso exhibition going on at El Centro Cultural Palacio de la Moneda so I we spent a few hours there.  That was interesting to learn more about Picasso and his life.  Honestly, after the whole thing was over I had mixed feelings about the guy.  The most interesting thing, however, was learning about the making of <span>Guernica</span> (unfortunately that one wasn’t being displayed, nor <span>Les demoiselles d’Avignon</span>).</p>
        <p>For lunch we headed over to Renzo’s uncles and got to chill with some real chileans.  (Remember that Renzo and his mom and brother are Peruvian).  They were all having their pisco sour and the mormons had inca kola, (which never gets old btw).  They were so fun to joke around with but you could tell that they weren’t Renzo’s favorite crowd to hang out with.  What I love about Renzo is he appreciates those sublime quiet scenes... it was good to go sightseeing around with the guy, and he really enjoyed it.  During the afternoon we went through the Plaza de Armas and I got some [uglyish] sunglasses and the cathedral there in the Plaza was one of the best I’ve seen in South America.  We did so much this day... uhh... we watched the Sunset from the Costanera, the tallest building in South America.  It was a nice few but I guess I don’t really get that excited about going to the tops of buildings but that’s what we did and it was fun.  We got home late and watched a show about Japan and I had some fideos.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[3].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[3].src}}"></div>
        <p>Sunday was great.  The sun was out and I really appreciated the heat.  We went to church and that was fun... one of the gringo elders didn’t really like me but the other one was way chill.  Me and Renzo then spent the afternoon in the city, we just laid on the grass on the Avenida Libertador Bernardo O’Higgins.  Renzo was really enjoying this (he doesn’t get out much haha).  After this we walked up the Avenida a little more and had some arepas (which somebody pointed out to me were Colombian and not Venezuelan) and yeah everything was great.  We were going to try to go to a devotional but that ended up not happening.  We also had arroz con pollo with the sauce you put on papas a la huancaina for dinner and I loved that.</p>
        <p>The Coast</p>
        <p>Monday was intense, we were all over the place on that day.  it consisted of visiting 3 different cities: Viña del Mar, Valparaiso, and Reñaca.  </p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[4].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[4].src}}"></div>

        <h3>Viña</h3>
        <p>We got up around 5:30 so that we could catch our bus heading to Viña del Mar.  It was really overcast when we arrived in Viña and I was worried it’d be a cold day.  Viña was a classy city.  There were a lot of castles along the coast... we saw all the famous places (the clock and the gardens and the amphitheater).  I tried palmeras for the first time and those became one of my fav snacks on that day.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[5].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[5].src}}"></div>
        <h3>Valparaiso</h3>
        <p>After the morning in Viña we hopped on a bus that took us 20 minutes south to Valparaiso.  I would say Valparaiso is one of the most beautiful cities I’ve been to.  Everything was on the hillside that plummeted into the sea.  We took a conveyer belt elevator up to high ground and had some nice views and then headed down and got on a boat and saw tons of sea lions.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[6].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[6].src}}"></div>

        <h3>Reñaca</h3>
        <p>Reñaca was the place that helped me soak in the summer more than anywhere.  By this point of the day the sun had came out and so we headed out to the beach.  Everybody talked about how cold the water was but it honestly wasn’t that bad... the only thing is that they didn’t let me go that far out.  I felt so happy at the beach in Reñaca and was not excited to go back to snowy Utah.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[7].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[7].src}}"></div>

        <p>Following our Reñaca excursion we faced some complications trying to get back to Santiago but we finally made it back around midnight.  The next day I had a little morning run and then said my goodbyes and that was that.  Getting home ended up being complicated but I don’t really want to remember all that stuff about missing my plane in Lima.</p>

        <h3>Prologue</h3>
        <p>Ok, so it’s the end of December and I’m about to head down to visit some friends in South America.  I’ve always wanted to travel and this trip I made was a pretty pivotal moment in my life because I came to realize I was capable of much more than what I initially thought.  Solo travel is a tough but amazing experience, it is one of the most empowering things you can do.</p>
        <h3>My trip to Central America</h3>
        <p>So the day before I had to leave I was getting excited and having a hard time working... it was hard to focus on anything and I kind of forgot about a few important things (aka money) but luckily my debit card had an issue which helped me remember everything I had to do and get things squared away so that my trip could be smooth sailing.  I got to the airport super early and had a good long wait before my flight, that was a good time to make some calls and get caught up with Jake and Vilchez.</p>
        <p>After a good long layover in LAX and a 5 hour overnight flight I was landing in San Jose.  It was understandably not one of my best nights but the change in scenery kept me awake for the first few hours I was in Costa Rica.  I got out of the airport after exchanging a few dollars for colones at a horrible rate.  San Jose was a beautiful verdant mountainous city.  I took a bus from the airport into the city which costed a few dollars.  Being in the bus was kind of my first taste of what I would be experiencing for the next two weeks.  It was then that I knew I could no longer speak English and I had no idea that I’d be sure when the bus had arrived in central San Jose, I did some asking and that made feel kind of awkward but that’s the way things go when you’re on your own.  From there I took a taxi to <em>el gran terminal del Caribe</em> which serves for getting to anywhere on the Caribbean side of the country. </p>
        <p>At the terminal I bought an extremely expensive bottle of water and was still kind of getting my bearings but somehow managed to buy my ticket and get into my seat.  I had a nice bus ride through the most beautiful mountain/cloud forest/jungle scenery.  I sat by an old lady who was on her way to visit her daughter in Limón, which was our final destination.</p>
        <br>
        <iframe frameBorder="0" ng-src="{{vidUrls[0]}}"></iframe>
        <br>
        <p>Arriving in Limón led to a little breakdown for me.  I was tired and hadn’t eaten and was trying to get my bearings and all of the sudden I was in this Caribbean port city and it was crowded and not a tourist area.  I called my mom and she talked me through things and then I went into the bank to exchange currency and that kind of helped me to be able to relax and come back to reality.  After exchanging currency I went over to this pensión (as they would call it in Perú) and I got a plate of beans, rice, chicken and plantain from this nice lady named Mayra.  Mayra was so friendly and we had a good little chat, after I was done eating her (ex) husband Eduardo came in and gave me a little history of the city of Limón.  Me and Eduardo walked down to the plaza which was right by the boardwalk (the boardwalk was consisted of all these earthquake ruins pretty much) and we saw the first Island on mainland America that Columbus saw/landed on supposedly.</p>
        <div class="{{articles[id].images[0].orientation}}"><img src="{{articles[id].images[0].src}}"></div>
        <br>
        <p>After a good chat with Mayra and Eduardo (and kind of following my plans) I decided to head out to a small beach town called Puerto Viejo de Talamanca.  It was a one hour bus ride out to Puerto Viejo and that place might be my favorite place in the world.  It was so tranquil and beautiful and I literally felt like it was forgotten by the rest of the world.  I felt free from all regular cares while I was there.  I had the best hostel, my room a little second story loft with a view of the jungle canopy.  I was dying.  The beach was also the best in the whole world, the sand was black and it was like a mattress and the water just felt good and not so irritating like the beaches on the Pacific.  I felt so good being there.  You could just see the rainforest clad mountains descend into the ocean.</p>
