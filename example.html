  <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <p>Over the 2015-2016 school year me and my cousin Sydney became really good friends.  We started talking about going to Guadalajara, Mexico to visit her family over the summer; and I love travelling so I was getting way excited about it but then I decided to take a summer job in Portland, Oregon, and that crushed our dreams.</p>
  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <p>On my first day on the job I ended up making an illegal u-turn which led to a car accident with the company van, I was immediately terminated.  This unfortunate event led to being a blessing in disguise, and made for me having a great summer.  After I learned I was fired I called Sydney and we decided that we’d make the trip to Guadalajara and a day later we had purchased plane tickets!  I got fired on Saturday and that Thursday was the day we were flying to Jalisco, it was too good to be true.</p>
  <h3>The Trip</h3>
  <p>So it turns out you can fly into Mexico for cheap by flying out of the Tijuana airport, which is right on the Mexico-US border, on Tuesday at 5:00 AM we left Provo and had a wonderful drive/bonding sesh on our way to Southern California, we arrived at Courtney’s house in Rancho Bernardo at about 4:00 in the afternoon and there were zero traffic issues the whole drive down.</p>

  <p>A friend of the Reed family drove us to the border crossing to the Tijuana airport where we spent $12 to cross directly from the US into Mexico and straight into the airport.  From there it was a 2 hour flight to Guadalajara.  On arrival in Guadalajara we were picked up by Ron and we met up with the family at a mall in Tlajomulco area, near the gated community they lived in.  My first taste of Jalisco was pollo con mole which was delish, unfortunately Sydney chose this peanut chicken dish that just tasted like peanuts... it was yuck!</p>

  <p>The next morning we hit the market, which was a taste of Peru all over again, the people were so friendly and let us try some guava.  The rest of the day was spent exploring Tlaquepaque, we had some great food and explored an old Mexican colonial town that had been absorbed by Guadalajara proper.  Tlaquepaque was beautiful!  I had this amazing drink called Cazuela, a mainly citrus fruit drink served in a bowl with a straw.</p>

  <p>Sunday was awesome!  We went to church with the Reeds and I was able to proselyte with the elders that night.  Teaching in Spanish took me right back to the mission like you wouldn’t believe!  Elder Starley, the gringo, was from Reno and he now goes to BYU, I see him every now and then in the Smith Fieldhouse, he and his comp were such good guys!</p>

  <p>Monday was a spa day for the girls while me and Ron hit Guachimontones, an archeological site that consisted of some stepped pyramids constructed by a society known as the Teuchitlán tradition.  It was a super interesting place and a lot of it remains unexcavated, there was a town nearby called Teuchitlán, it was a beautiful little place and they were having a big festival and there was free beer.  The car battery ran out of charge so that added a little bit of interest to our afternoon, we were able to make the hour drive back to Tlajomulco by turning off everything electrical in the car, making for a windy trip back.</p>

  <p>Me and Sydney decided to rough it out on our own for a little bit and I was dying to hit the beach, so we got a good deal at the Westin in Puerto Vallarta and some bus tickets to get out there.  We got up early Tuesday morning to get to the Zapopan terminal to catch our bus and it was a long, but beautiful drive.  The small mexican towns we passed were incredible, with the cathedrals so visible in the center of each one as we passed by.  Probably the highlight of the trip though was the bathroom, I think I walked in on someone and then when Sydney went in she didn’t come out for like 20 minutes, I guess she was having a hard time keeping her balance.</p>

  <p>Our arrival in Puerto Vallarta was beyond exciting.  We got out of the bus terminal and I talked to this pregnant girl for a little bit who explained the bus system (they call them camiones) so we’d be able to make it to the hotel and then to el centro and el malecón.  It was about noon and we weren’t able to check in until 1:00 so we decided catch a camión heading straight for the boardwalk where we’d have lunch, it was the champions league semifinal that day so we stopped at a restaurant and watched part of the Manchester City vs. Real Madrid game (Real won).  After that we got back in a bus heading to our hotel.  It felt so cool to be on our own in PV, it was a big deal for both of us.  After a 45 minute bus ride and a half an hour walk we finally made it to the Westin, which was awesome.  It was the nicest place but kind of awkward cuz the bathroom wasn’t very private haha.  We spent the rest of daylight in paradise, we spent some time in the ocean on the empty beach and then in the pool, which was so nice with the coconut trees and the breeze.</p>

  <p>That night we set out to go clubbing.  We ate outside at this dope restaurant on the beach, I had this really good ceviche oh man.  Then we walked along the boardwalk and there was tons of random things going on, when we got to where all clubs were we were disappointed to find out that like all the clubs were basically empty (I mean, it was Tuesday night).  At about 11:30 we took a taxi back to the hotel and we were both dead tired.</p>

  <br>
  <p>The next morning we had chilaquiles for breakfast at this little restaurant across the street from the hotel and then tried to maximize our time at the beach before we’d have to check out of the hotel, the morning went by too quickly and I felt like I needed more time at the pool, but we made the most of it, checking out right at the latest time possible.  We then had a few hours in the city before our bus left.  It was a lot of fun to chill in the city, we had some really good fish tacos and we watched the Atletico Madrid beat Bayern Munich.</p>
  <p>I felt like the bus ride home was really pleasant, but poor Sydney was getting car sick.  We had some more really good deep conversations and that’s just one of those times that I’ll always remember, we were able make the most of all the hours and hours we spent together in cars/busses/planes, I get nostalgic thinking about all that.</p>

  <p>Looking back, it seems amazing to me that we did so much.  I’m not even done.  We were able to go to the temple and help clean up the next day, I had a good heart to heart with one of the workers there who was having a hard time cuz he felt like it wouldn’t work out for him to get married hehe, but honestly that kid was awesome (what was his name?... Franco?...crap).  There was an outlet outside of city limits and Aunty Michelle let me drive out there with Sydney and Baylie, I felt cool.  I found these ray-bans that were only 60 bucks and sometimes I still think about them:p.</p>

  <p>Our last full day was spent in the Guadalajara city center.  We saw some old buildings and had some birria and this other thing that I forgot what it was called... also this cactus fruit that was way refreshing.</p>

  <p>We got up early to get to the airport and the flight home felt long, I always get claustrophobic in planes.  After that we hit VG’s donuts which I loved but it’s kind of weird cuz they only accept cash.  After that we headed up to spend the evening in OC, where we stayed with Sydney’s aunt and uncle, they were so nice to us!  The next day we got up super early, and ended up arriving in Provo around 3:30... so props to us!!</p>
